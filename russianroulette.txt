Russian Roulette
by Quest Games

It’s a battle of wits in this Soviet mind game!
The rule of the game is simple: plug in your Nintendo Zapper™ Lightgun, pull the trigger... and pray. 
Two players, six chambers, one bullet. See who comes out alive. 
Try a higher difficulty for a more risky challenge. Square off against another player or play against the CPU.
Still up to the challenge? Then you’d better be lucky. Otherwise it’s lights out in this thrilling Nintendo Light Gun game!
Battery back-up saves the high scores.
