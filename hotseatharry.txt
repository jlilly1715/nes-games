The year is 7250 AD, and the judicial systems of the world have crumbled. Civil and Criminal cases are now settled in an arena-style trial to the death. 
The Plaintiff and the Defendant are strapped into modified Electric Chairs and forced to use their legs to push the "Hydro-Electric Foot Pedals", which, therefore, in turn, 
causes an electric current to course through his/her/it's opponent's body. There is no settlement. There is no plea-bargain.
Electric Justice for All!!!

That's how the story of Strangulation Games' first release goes, a game which sure would've been a killer if it had been released back in the NES games and published by Active Enterprises
or Color Dreams. Your objective of the game basicly is to hit your joypad A button over and over until it comes loose and drop off. Every time you win the color on the screen changes, 
very fun indeed!!
