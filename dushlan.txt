Dúshlán
by Peter McQuillan

It's that game with the blocks, but not being Tetris.
Dúshlán(pronounced roughly do-slan, it's Irish for "challenge").
The game itself is pretty fun, and is basically Tetris with various added challenges. 

I had no idea what it was about other than tetris, so I gave it a russian song. 
In the second half, the drum section is a complete ripoff of Bonetrousle.
