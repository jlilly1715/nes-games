31 in 1 Real Game!
by Mojon Twins

Mojon Twins' take on a "magnificent chinese multicart". It's hilarious and a must try even though some games may suck :-)
"We would like to share with you all our own Multicart. 31 real games! Lots of laughs! Facepalms! Controllers flying accross the room! 
Mysterious secrets! Fake names! Repeat games with different sprites! Everything in 3 megabits full of love and kisses."
