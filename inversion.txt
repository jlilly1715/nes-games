INVERSION
by Red Moon Games

A boy named "Satoshi" form human village suffers from unique type of solor blindness-he can see things as either black or white. 
However, Satoshi have also a special ability, thanks to it he can change the "State of Darkness". 
It allows him to make some object solid and vice versa! Your aim in the game is to collect all keys from each map to open doors leading to next level. 
Use B button to change state of darkness.This will result in changing map colors and, more importantly, solidness of objects. 
Use springs, moving platforms, vertical conveyor belts and levers to your adventage! Satoshi is pretty weak kid- he will die if hit by anything hostile, 
like bullets, spikes or ghost. Also, Satoshi can't survive going off screen, so be careful.
