Forehead Block Guy
By NovaYoshi

Launch blocks from your forehead to stun enemies. Then touch them once stunned to finish the job. Kill all the enemies to proceed to the next level.

FHBG, A.K.A. Forehead Block Guy, is a simple, single-screen platform NES game inspired by Fast Eddie and Gimmick!, and was an entry to the 2011 NESDEV competition.
The objective is to clear all of the enemies in each level by throwing your blocks to stun them, before stomping on them a la good ol' Super Mario style.
