Double Action Blaster Guys
by NovaSquirrel

Double Action Blaster Guys is the sequel to my contribution to the 2011 compo, Forehead Block Guy.
It's completely rewritten so it's nowhere near as buggy as FHBG was, and I took the opportunity to rewrite it with two simultaneous players in mind, hence pluralizing Guy in the title.

Features:
* Simultaneous two-player support (either player can join in at any time by pressing A+B)
* 32 levels
* Over a dozen enemy types, plus a final boss
* Several types of blocks (not just solid and empty like the original FHBG)
* 4 different level goal types
* Level editor
* Open source
