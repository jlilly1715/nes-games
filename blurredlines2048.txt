Blurred Lines 2048
by Ray Dempsey

My first NES Homebrew game is now complete. Basically, it is a remake of the popular mobile game "2048" but enhanced with the music of Blurred Lines.
It is a shot-for-shot recreation of the music video complete with dancing half-naked ladies and music that is very accurate to the original song.
The game is meant to be a novelty - people will probably play it through once and then show a friend.
Let me know what you think! Yes I understand many people hate this song.
I used to like it somewhat but after having to hear it 1000 times to study it, I don't want to hear it anymore.
