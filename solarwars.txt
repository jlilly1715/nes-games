Solar Wars V1.5
by Chris M. Cowell

sometime in the 22nd century, mankind felt cocky enough to engage in a global nuclear war.
As a result, almost the entire world population was wiped out. All that are left are a couple of small, feuding factions of people.
Since there is not enough arable land left on Earth any more, the warring factions took to the stars to fight over the celestial bodies: The Planets.
You and an opponent are on opposing sides of the war. Armed with your high-powered spatial battletanks, you will have to carve your own slice out of the solar system.
