Jet Paco - Space Agent!
by Mojo Twins

Taking control of Paco Rebollez, you're tasked with finding and gathering energonia crystals, a rare and unusual material used to energise spacecrafts. 
To help with his journey, Paco is equipped with a state of the art jet pack which allows our homebrew hero to glide around the many rooms of an abandonded ship containing gems galore.
