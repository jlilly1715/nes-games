Pogo Cats
by YGGI

Here is a homebrew title where you play as a greaser or pinup girl and pogo stick your way upwards to complete levels.
The gameplay is very simple. You need to jump to upper platforms. Each pixel scrolling will give you 1 point. 
If you fall down the screen, you’ll loose. The goal is to make as many points as possible.
