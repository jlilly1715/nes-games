Paint or Draw (2017) 
by dougeff

A new NES drawing game. It has 2 modes: Paint mode, you choose any 4 colors for the palette. 
Draw mode, you choose any color, and drawing darkens (or lightens) like a pencil/eraser. 
Doodle anything you want. Your favorite NES character? 
Or you can use this as a game development tool, to sketch your sprites within the emulator itself.
