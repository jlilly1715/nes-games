RALPH 4
by pubby

A top-down game where the player controls Ralph, a happy dwarf in a blue outfit, and must guide him through 20 floors of the Evil Bear Lair.
Be careful to not run Ralph into the bears that roam the Lair, as doing so kills Ralph and he will have to restart the floor.
Release Date	18 April 2016
