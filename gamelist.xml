You are John Solver, fearless bomb squad person, who has to save the city from Jack, a demented criminal who is trying to blow it all up with his bombs. Each level is a maze and you have to move around walls to be able to reach a bomb, but it&apos;s not as easy as it seems as not just any wall can be moved (obviously). If you don&apos;t make it to the bomb in time, it will explode and you&apos;re toasted (and loose a life). The game includes no less than 99 levels, so get gaming!</desc>

          <desc>The year is 7250 AD, and the judicial systems of the world have crumbled. Civil and Criminal cases are now settled in an arena-style trial to the death. The Plaintiff and the Defendant are strapped into modified Electric Chairs and forced to use their legs to push the "Hydro-Electric Foot Pedals", which, therefore, in turn, causes an electric current to course through his/her/it&apos;s opponent&apos;s body. There is no settlement. There is no plea-bargain. Electric Justice for All!!! That&apos;s how the story of Strangulation Games&apos; first release goes, a game which sure would&apos;ve been a killer if it had been released back in the NES games and published by Active Enterprises or Color Dreams. Your objective of the game basicly is to hit your joypad A button over and over until it comes loose and drop off. Every time you win the color on the screen changes, very fun indeed!!</desc>

Successfully leap over 100 of them, and you win the game! Use the Start button to begin the game, or reset the game during a game over. Use the A button to jump. Happy trails!</desc>

Can you be villainous and enslave a population of relatively peaceful goblins? Only you can answer these questions in The Rise of Amondus, an exciting and action-packed prequel to The Mad Wizard, and the second installment of The Candelabra Epic!</desc>

          <desc>sometime in the 22nd century, mankind felt cocky enough to engage in a global nuclear war. As a result, almost the entire world population was wiped out. All that are left are a couple of small, feuding factions of people. Since there is not enough arable land left on Earth any more, the warring factions took to the stars to fight over the celestial bodies: The Planets. You and an opponent are on opposing sides of the war. Armed with your high-powered spatial battletanks, you will have to carve your own slice out of the solar system.</desc>

          <desc>A hippie guitarist who has visited your small town for years has gone rogue and launched ICBMs toward your town. Break out the fireworks that you had been saving for Independence Day, turn them into makeshift anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), and shoot down the incoming missiles. Each of two silos starts with 15 ABMs. Place the aiming cursor in front of the incoming missile and fire an ABM to destroy it. Defend the town for seven nights (Sunday through Saturday) and you win! Screen shows cursor, missiles, balloon, MIRV, explosions, ammo, score, and time.Game play screen. Click to show or hide names of the game objects. You have to lead your shot a bit because it takes a split second for the ABM to arrive. But the explosion of an ABM is wide enough to destroy several missiles, so aim where the incoming missiles&apos; paths are about to cross. Balloons and multiple independent reentry vehicle (MIRV) missiles will release a payload of multiple missiles if not shot down promptly. At the end of each round, the silos are refilled with ABMs: 15 each or 20 if only one silo remains. A destroyed silo will get rebuilt at the end of a night or once you&apos;ve lasted one round with no destroyed houses. And if a house has been destroyed, one house will be rebuilt the next day. Later in the week, when more houses are gone, you need not worry about missiles aimed at wreckage. The game is over once both silos or all ten houses have been destroyed, or once you have survived all seven nights.</desc>

          <desc>In the distant future, mankind is at war with Carcossians. The war has lasted for generations, but the Carcossians&apos; superior forces and firepower have begun to wear on the determined earth forces. The tide of war is turning, and something must be done, or mankind will be lost. But there is hope. A new device, dubbed the Wraith engine, allows a ship to be cloaked in a subspace field, allowing it to pass through solid matter unharmed. So far the device can only work on a small ship and for limited period of time. Earth forces believe that a small vessel fitted with the wraith engine may be able to break through Carcossian defenses to perform a tactical strike against one of their bases. As Toliv Pisan, one of Earth&apos;s top pilots, you have been chosen to pilot one of the Wraith ships and attempt a solo strike against a heavily guarded Carcossian base. Control your ship using the directional pad.  Fire using the B button, and cloak using the A button.  While cloaked you cannot be harmed, but you can only remained cloaked as long as you have energy, which is constantly depleted while cloaked. Your ship is also equipped with high grade plasma bombs.  Normally a small ship like the one you&apos;ll be piloting wouldn&apos;t be able to escape the blast radius after launching one.  However the Wraith engine will allow you to use a bomb and remain unscathed.  To use a bomb, cloak and press the B button. You can also pick up power ups.  There are extra bombs (max 10), extra lives (max 10), extra energy, shields (protects you from one hit), speed, wide shot, and energy reduce (makes cloaking use energy more slowly).You can&apos;t pick up power ups while cloaked, and are hard mode if you shoot a power up it will be destroyed.  You can gain extra powerups by destroying certain groups of enemies! There are three levels of difficulty.  The main difference between them is the starting number of lives and bombs.  On hard mode you additionally have less energy and you&apos;ll have to avoid shooting power ups.</desc>

          <desc>Playing the role of a secretary in her trial period at a new job, you have to work your way through an increasingly difficult week without being fired for failing to answer calls on time. Each single screen level (wrapping on both horizontal and vertical axes) consists of an arrangement of platforms and staircases upon which are placed a number of phones and filing cabinets. When a phone rings, the topic that the call is about is represented by a symbol above the handset - and your task is to run to the matching filing cabinet then answer the call before the phone rings off. It starts of simple enough, with day one based on a symmetrical level with only two phones and two cabinets, but the difficulty soon ramps up with devious platform placement and a variety of obstructive NPC&apos;s thrown into the mix. The boss slows you down with his unhelpful remarks (just like in real life) and chatting with the office gossip-girl can leave you confused and swap over the topic currently held in your single-track mind. Then there&apos;s the delivery guy knocking people over and the oh-so-essential and distracting office romance - although thankfully there is also a coffee machine to provide you with a caffeine-fuelled speed boost to help you overcome all these obstacles. It&apos;s a simple yet compulsive concept that would work equally well as a browser-based casual game or modern console indie title, so to see Zooming Secretary make it&apos;s debut on the original &apos;family computer&apos; is particularly exciting.</desc>
