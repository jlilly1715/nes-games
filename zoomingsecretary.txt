Zooming Secretary V1.02
by Shiru & PinWizz

From Shiru's notes about the game...
Game concept with a secretary and phones was proposed by me as the very first random idea for this smaller project, and we decided to stick with it.
Unlike all my previous NES game projects, this one turned out to be an original, not a clone or remake or upgrade of existing game.
