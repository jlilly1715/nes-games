Wraith
by Tom Livak

In the distant future, mankind is at war with Carcossians.
The war has lasted for generations, but the Carcossians’ superior forces and firepower have begun to wear on the determined earth forces.
The tide of war is turning, and something must be done, or mankind will be lost. But there is hope.
A new device, dubbed the Wraith engine, allows a ship to be cloaked in a subspace field, allowing it to pass through solid matter unharmed.
So far the device can only work on a small ship and for limited period of time.
Earth forces believe that a small vessel fitted with the wraith engine may be able to break through Carcossian defenses to perform a tactical strike against one of their bases.
As Toliv Pisan, one of Earth’s top pilots, you have been chosen to pilot one of the Wraith ships and attempt a solo strike against a heavily guarded Carcossian base.
