Wo Xiang Niao Niao
by Mojon Twins

Lin Lin knows the Frog King won't be pleased until he receives _at least_ eight flies, and he's blocking the toilet. Gosh, that's a bummer. 
So she has to collect at least eight flies on her way to the toilet (which is located uhm... straight to the right) for the King to let her use it.
The path is full of baddies which can hurt Lin Lin very badly, but luckily she can bounce on them with her butt. So good her mother made her eat so many mantous!
If a baddie touches Lin Lin she will lose part of her clothes and will be vulnerable. Luckily you can regain your clothes with an item.
If Lin Lin falls off a ledge or gets hurt by a baddie she will have to start over, unless she touches a magic poo to save her progress.
If she gets killed, she'll be respawned where the poo was.
Lin Lin also knows that if she happens to get to the frog with more than 8 flies, she'll gain access to the celestian realm (i.e. the bonus stage)
where she can gain some extra flies which will count for the second segment of each level...
... which has an autoadvancing scroll. Lin Lin shouldn't let the screen go faster than her, she must RUN. And she still has to collect the flies. And pee.
