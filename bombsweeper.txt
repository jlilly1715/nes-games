Bomb Sweeper V0.5
by Snowbro

Kent Hansen of SnowBro Software fame's clone of an old Game & Watch game from 1987 called Bomb Sweeper. 
You are John Solver, fearless bomb squad person, who has to save the city from Jack, a demented criminal who is trying to blow it all up with his bombs.
Each level is a maze and you have to move around walls to be able to reach a bomb, but it's not as easy as it seems as not just any wall can be moved (obviously). 
If you don't make it to the bomb in time, it will explode and you're toasted (and loose a life). The game includes no less than 99 levels, so get gaming!
